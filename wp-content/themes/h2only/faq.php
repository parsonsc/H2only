			<p><strong>What is H2Only?</strong></p>
			<p>A 10-day challenge to drink nothing but water, to raise money for the RNLI. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>When does it start finish? </strong></p>
			<p>Say goodbye to your favourite drinks on 2 June at 5pm and be reunited with them again on 12 June at 5pm (just in time to party).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I drink sparkling water?</strong></p>
			<p>If it’s sparking, it’s not H2Only. So that’s a “no” to fizz, I’m afraid.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I drink squash/cordial?</strong></p>
			<p>Flavour? Oh no. Water only if you want to be a true H2Only.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I eat food?</strong></p>
			<p>Yes of course you can. You must! Just make sure your drinks are strictly watery. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I eat soup? How about cuppa soup?</strong></p>
			<p>Tricky one. If it’s food, it OK with us. So if you eat it with a spoon, yes. If you drink it from a cup, no.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I have milk on my cereal?</strong></p>
			<p>As long as you’re eating it. No tipping the bowl for a slurp. It’s spoons only, for our H2Onlies. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I add things like mint, lemon or strawberries to my water to flavour it?</strong></p>
			<p>Sounds like cheating to us. If you’re drinking it, it has to be pure, unadulterated water. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I chew coffee beans?</strong></p>
			<p>Well this falls into the ‘eating’ category. So technically, yes. But we wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Can I cheat? </strong></p>
			<p>Yes, you shall go to the ball/wedding/party. Grab a lifeline for 24 hours and it’ll cost you a donation of £24 to our lifeline pot at </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></p>
			<p>It helps the RNLI’s amazing lifeboat crews, lifeguards and volunteers to save lives at sea. </p>
